# Astrostatistics Simulations

This repository contains my original simulations and model explorations, inspired by the **Astrostatistics Summer School (2025)** hosted by **Penn State University**. The program introduced me to some of the statistical techniques used in analyzing astronomical data ‚Äî particularly under uncertainty and noise.

**"The cosmos is full of signals. Statistics helps us listen better."**

This repo is a reflection of my post-course experimentation using:
- **Bayesian inference**
- **MCMC sampling**
- **Signal detection in time series**

All code and content in this repository is independently created or sourced from public domain references.

## ‚úçÔ∏è My Reflections

This repository marks a pivotal point in my journey from statistics to astrophysics. I began to see the cosmos not just as a physical entity, but as a source of noisy signals begging for probabilistic interpretation. Bayesian methods don't just *predict* ‚Äî they *infer*, *update*, and *adapt* in the face of uncertainty.

It also made me curious about applying similar tools in domains like **financial markets**, **biomedical signal processing**, and **anomaly detection in time series** ‚Äî where the art of "seeing through the noise" is just as vital.
